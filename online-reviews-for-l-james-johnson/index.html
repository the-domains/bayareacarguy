I drove off in a 2014 Civic. This was the best experience ever. James was the second salesman I met at Honda and I told him I wanted to continue working with him. James didn't try to "sell" me the vehicle. He answered my questions and never pressured me. I told him I was also looking at a Prius. He wisely didn't say anything negative about Toyota. He understood that choosing a car is a personal choice. The incredible professionalism was very much appreciated. </p><p>I highly recommend James...and am telling my friends to see the deals at Honda.
