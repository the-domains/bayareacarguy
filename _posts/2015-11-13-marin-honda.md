I once wrote that car buyers desperately want to work with real people. They're looking for a transparent, authentic salesperson who shuns "old school" selling tactics. No gimmicks. No tricks. 

After publishing automotive books and writing for High Gear Media and TheCarConnection.com, I'm back wearing a familiar hat as Internet Sales Manager with Marin Honda in San Rafael, CA. 

Consumer-friendly Marin Honda gives me the freedom to practice what I preach. 

If you're looking for a new Honda, a Honda Certified Used Car, or any other pre-owned vehicle, give me call or text to 510-648-5536\.
