My daughter just bought her first car, a new Civic, from Marin Honda. Salesman was L James Johnson. Mr. Johnson treated my daughter very well. He clearly knows a great deal about the cars he is selling and explained the options and features patiently and completely. The price my daughter paid was, in my opinion, very fair. No silly selling tactics like those that my daughter encountered at other dealerships. (It was these ridiculous tactics that prompted me to come up from Southern California to provide moral support.

I really feel grateful for your help with buying the car. Your lovely, grounded presence was such a gift as I went through the process. And I am so happy with my beautiful new Civic

I want to show my appreciation for James Johnson. I first leased a car from him three years ago and remember how helpful he was. When it came time to get another car for me, as well as one for my daughter, I returned for James' help. Again, his integrity, willingness to go the extra miles, and his gentle manner made what is usually a stressful situation extremely easy.

I want to thank you again for such a seamless car-looking and buying experience! I am thoroughly spoiled, and now forever ruined if I attempt it without you! If only every saleman could have the intelligence, patience, and heart you bring!

So happy we bought here. You can read my other reviews on the horrible car dealers we experienced prior to this. We just bought a brand new civic, James was our sales guy. Soooo nice, and I think he should have some sort of best car salesman ever! The dealer is nice clean, and our son enjoyed the free popcorn. Just an awesome experience here. We will be back when we need a new car.

Buying my Honda Accord was A very nice experience for me due to James Johnson that answered all of the many questions I had about cars and help me find the right car ; then he helped me to understanding the security features, the electronic devices and gadgets in the car and taught me how to use them. He had patience and kindness, even after the car was sold he kept helping me.

So I will recommend him because it made a huge difference after spending time at other dealers.

Outstanding experience!  I drove off in a 2014 Civic.  This was the best experience ever.  James was the second salesman I met at Honda and I told him I wanted to continue working with him.  James didn't try to "sell" me the vehicle.  He answered my questions and never pressured me.  I told him I was also looking at a Prius.  He wisely didn't say anything negative about Toyota.  He understood that choosing a car is a personal choice.  The incredible professionalism was very much appreciated.  

I highly recommend James...and am telling my friends to see the deals at Honda. This is my first Honda and they have won my allegiance and I will definitely be a repeat customer!
